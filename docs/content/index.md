# HomeOps

This repository contains my personal home infrastructure, defined and deployed as code using [IaC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code), and [GitOps](https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops/) practices where possible.

## Goals

My home infrastructure helps support much of what I do everyday and is designed with the following goals in mind:

- High service uptime
- High fault tolerance
- Best practice security
- Privacy by design
- Efficient resource utilization
- Low power, noise, and space

## Layers

My home infrastructure is broken up into layers which very loosely align with the concepts of [IaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_a_service), [PaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service), and [SaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service). Modularizing the infrastructure in this way helps me isolate dependencies, and avoid deployment problems.

- The [Software Layer](https://bcbrookman.github.io/homeops/software-layer/) provides the applications and services that users interact with. It includes deployed applications, along with their definitions and configurations.
- The [Platform Layer](https://bcbrookman.github.io/homeops/platform-layer/) provides the platforms which applications and services are deployed on in the Software Layer. It includes for example, guest operating systems, container orchestration platforms (i.e. [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)).
- The [Infrastructure Layer](https://bcbrookman.github.io/homeops/infrastructure-layer/) provides the basic networking, storage, and compute resources used by the Platform Layer. It includes physical hardware, hypervisors, and other infrastructure components.
